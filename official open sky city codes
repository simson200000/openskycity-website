<p><span style="color: #ff6600;">Ultimate Goal: Being a good local government or governor (if offline AI manages the government). Long Concept of Game: First, the player starts with a big world, or a region. He chooses a place to start in the region. Then he builds a City, and manages Traffic, Population and more, then he chooses another place in the same region or the big world (name is your choice).</span></p>

<span style="color: #3366ff;">He builds another City in the place he chose, then he connects the two cities with Roads, Trains, Ships, Aircrafts, and much more. That's it, building is done, now the player can play the city, he can travel and view his city in the first person view and like that. After these done, we plan to implement Multiplayers. Multiple players can build a same city. And they can team work to manage a good government. This game helps to learn something good: OpenSkyCity helps the player to build up his own government and helpsgjg him to learn how to manage money and more.</span>
